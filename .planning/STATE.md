# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-04)

**Core value:** Builders can confidently configure game balance without needing to understand every formula interaction
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 6 (presets)
Plan: 2 of 2
Status: Phase complete — ready for verification
Last activity: 2026-04-05

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 0
- Average duration: -
- Total execution time: 0 hours

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 6 phases derived from requirement categories -- Foundation, Presets, Wizard Workspace, Comparison View, Apply Flow, Visualizations
- [Roadmap]: Phases 5 and 6 can run in parallel (both depend on Phase 4, not on each other)
- [Roadmap]: UI-04 (tooltips) assigned to Phase 4 (Comparison View) where fields are displayed, not Phase 1
- [Phase 01-foundation]: DeepPartial defined locally in tuning types.ts rather than re-exported from templates.ts
- [Phase 01-foundation]: computeMetrics uses base stat 10 and classHpPerLevel 3 as reasonable comparison defaults
- [Phase 01-foundation]: 137 tunable scalar fields cataloged; diff engine uses FIELD_METADATA for tunable-path filtering
- [Phase 02-presets]: Fixed DeepPartial type to handle optional object properties using NonNullable
- [Phase 02-presets]: Casual XP exponent 1.6, Balanced 1.8, Hardcore 2.2 for distinct leveling curves
- [Phase 02-presets]: FULL_MOCK_CONFIG uses minimal complete AppConfig entries for validation testing
- [Phase 02-presets]: Metric differentiation tested at levels 20 and 50 with 2x XP and 1.4x HP spread thresholds

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1 formula accuracy depends on cross-referencing Kotlin source in reference/ directory
- Preset numeric values (Phase 2) require game design judgment -- plan for iteration
